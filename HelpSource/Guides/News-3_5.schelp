SECTION:: Language-side news

subsection:: Qt GUI
A new cross-platform and custom styled GUI system that replaces Cocoa and SwingOSC.

subsection:: SCDoc
A new help-system provides consistent documentation with good introspection and easy link::Search##searching:: and link::Browse##browsing::.

The help-files are written in a markup language which is then parsed and used to generate HTML files, which are displayed with the new link::Classes/WebView:: widget inside the link::Classes/HelpBrowser::.

See link::Classes/SCDoc::, link::Reference/SCDocSyntax::, link::Guides/WritingHelp::.

Also a new method link::Classes/Help#*methodArgs:: returns a human-readable string of arguments and default values for a method. Example: code::Help.methodArgs("SinOsc.ar")::

subsection:: OSC and MIDI responders
The new link::Classes/OSCFunc:: and link::Classes/MIDIFunc:: provides better alternatives to the old link::Classes/OSCresponderNode:: and link::Classes/NoteOnResponder::, etc.

OSCFunc can receive on any port, not only the main code::NetAddr.langPort::.

subsection:: Moved startup and config files
The sclang startup file has moved to code:: thisProcess.platform.userConfigDir +/+ "sclang.scd" ::
and the library configuration file moved to code:: thisProcess.platform.userConfigDir +/+ "sclang.cfg" ::

subsection:: Sced3
The GEdit plugin sced has been updated to support GEdit version 3.

subsection:: WiiMote
code::WiiMote.discover:: now returns the device object, or nil if it failed.

subsection:: Bus-asMap in patterns
Bus-asMap symbols are now allowed in code::\freq:: and friends in patterns.

subsection:: Warn on classlib overwrites
Warnings are posted when extensions overwrites methods in main class lib, unless the extensions are put in a subfolder named "SystemOverwrites".

subsection:: Filesystem utils
New cross-platform filesystem utilities: link::Classes/File#*copy::, link::Classes/File#*mtime::, link::Classes/File#*mkdir::, link::Classes/File#*realpath::, link::Classes/File#*type::, link::Classes/File#*fileSize::

subsection:: String-openTextFile
link::Classes/String#-openTextFile:: now works also on frontends without link::Classes/Document:: support. It falls back to link::Classes/String#-openOS:: to open the file with the default application for that file type.

subsection:: Various bugfixes
A lot of bugs has been fixed, for example: String regexp primitives, multichannel wrappers of SequenceableCollection, CoinGate.ar, T2K, WiiMote, SynthDesc.

SECTION:: Server-side news

subsection:: Bitwise ops
The bitwise operators code::&:: (and), code::|:: (or), code:: xor: :: (xor), code::<<:: (left shift) and code::>>:: (right shift) are now supported server-side on audio and control signals. Example:
code::
// 8-bit magic
(
play {
    var t = PulseCount.ar(Impulse.ar(8e3));
    HPF.ar(
        (
            ((t * 15) & (t >> 5)) |
            ((t * 5)  & (t >> [3, 4])) |
            ((t * 2)  & (t >> 9)) |
            ((t * 8)  & (t >> 11))
            - 3 % 256
        ) / 127-1 * 3
        , 20
    ).tanh
}
)

subsection:: VarLag UGen
The new link::Classes/VarLag:: UGen provides the same functionality as Lag but with linear and other curves.

subsection:: Node-onFree
A new method link::Classes/Node#-onFree:: runs a function when node finished playing.

subsection:: LocalIn initial value
link::Classes/LocalIn:: now has an input for initial value.

subsection:: Close buffers on free
teletype::/b_free:: also free's soundfile if open (like teletype::/b_close::)

subsection:: More done flags
link::Classes/Demand::, link::Classes/VDiskIn:: and link::Classes/DiskIn:: now sets done flag (to be used by link::Classes/Done:: or link::Classes/FreeSelfWhenDone::)

subsection:: SuperNova
A new multi-processor implementation of scsynth.
