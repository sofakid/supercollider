summary:: Runtime environment for the virtual machine and interpreter.

description::
A Process is the runtime environment for the virtual machine and interpreter.
It has a subclass named link::Classes/Main:: which is where you should override the methods
of Process. There are two methods of interest. One is named code::startup:: and is
called after the class library has been compiled. The other is named code::run:: and
is called when the user chooses the Run menu command.

classMethods::

method::tailCallOptimize
Get or set tail call optimization. The default is on. Setting this to code::false:: can help with debugging by including intermediate levels in an error backtrace.

instanceMethods::

method::startup

called after the class library has been compiled. Override this in class link::Classes/Main:: to do whatever you want.

method::run

called when the user chooses the Run menu command. Override this in class link::Classes/Main:: to do whatever you want.

method::mainThread

Returns the main link::Classes/Thread:: belonging to the process.

discussion::
Code evaluated in code editor, on command line, scheduled on clocks, or evaluated
in response to incoming OSC and MIDI messages initially runs within the main thread.
However, as soon as a link::Classes/Routine:: is started, it becomes the
link::Classes/Thread#.thisThread#current thread::.
